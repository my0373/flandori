What content do we need to manage ?

What metadata do we need to retain ?

What sources will we accept content from ?

Where will we deliver content ?

How do we ensure the integrity of the content ?

How can we distribute content in a highly available (and secure) way ?
- idea, maybe a bittorrent like peer to peer content distribution ?
- could blockchain do something cool here ?


How do we version content ?
- crazy idea, possibly use specific container labels for specific content to track specific versions of content to a local provider.
Needs more thought.

How do we present content in many different ways to many different systems ?

How do we enforce (or do we even want to) the metadata captured from the source ?
